## The Cub Scout Pack

The BSA program for K-5th grade is Cub Scouts and is organized into local units called packs. The pack is made up of Dens organized by grade level. The Dens meet once a week. Pack meetings are led by the Cubmaster once a month.  
Pack meetings may have games, skits, ceremonies, and presentations of awards the Scouts have earned during the previous months.  
All of the leaders in the pack are volunteers that do their best to ensure that your cub has a wonderful experience in Scouting. The pack is run by the Pack Committee. Pack Committee Members are parents and other adults that volunteer to help run the pack. The Chartered Organization Representative leads committee meetings. The Pack Committee typically meets once per month on a date chosen coordinated by principal leaders who need to be present.
Parents are always invited to attend and contribute. They can fully participate by registering as a committee member.  
The pack is owned by a "chartered organization". Chartered organizations include schools, religious organizations, service clubs, and other non-profit organizations. Our Chartered Organization is Emmanuel United Methodist Church. Chartered Organizations approve all leadership in the pack, provide resources and legal framework for the pack, and assist the pack in following BSA guidelines, policies, and procedures. The chartered organization selects a Chartered Organization Representative who serves as the contact person for your pack. Our Chartered Organization Representative is Lew Claycomb.

Cub Scout Pack 46 meets every Monday night at 7pm. Meetings usually last around one hour.  
We meet at Emmanuel United Methodist Church located at 2732 Martinsburg Pike Stephenson, VA 22656:
